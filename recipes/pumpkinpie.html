        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This pumpkin pie dump cake is like a pumpkin pie topped with buttery, crunchy cake. Using spice cake mix for the topping, it's extra easy, with minimal measuring.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>cooking spray</li>
                <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can pure pumpkin puree</li>
                <li>1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 (15 ounce) package spice cake mix</li>
                <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease the sides of a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Add pumpkin puree, evaporated mik, eggs, sugar, and cinnamon to a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Mixture should be runny.</li>
                <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Carefully sprinkle an even layer of cake mix on top of pumpkin mixture. Pour melted butter evenly over cake mix.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until only a slight jiggle remains at the center of the cake, 50 to 60 minutes. Allow the cake to cool at least 1 hour to set. Serve or refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
            </ol>
